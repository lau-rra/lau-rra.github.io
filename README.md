# Reflection

Whew, the website is done for now! Time to reflect:

The overall task was huge, and it took me hours. I once again lost track of time, but Iâ€™d estimate it took +25 hours. Luckily, I had already built a solid foundation with HTML and CSS in the previous assignment, so converting that to React and building on top of it was relatively smooth. When it came to solving problems with JavaScript, I had to Google and use AI quite a bit, but I managed to make everything look okay in the end. I had previously created the small snow blizzard game with PyGame, so I translated it into JavaScript with AI's help.

Overall, I wish the course had been longer, I had so many questions while finalizing the website, and the course was so fun! c: I didn't have time to set up my own website, so I used github.io, but I really hope to implement this properly on a personal site later. I tried to do every other task except the CMS as I didn't have time for that.

I plan to keep working on this website since I came up with lots of ideas to improve both its usability and design!
Last minute edit: I disabled the sweeping motion in the blizzard "game" on mobile devices as it lagged so much.
